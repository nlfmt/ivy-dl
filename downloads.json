Bigger ones.

Those are a bit complex to do with Lego so I used simpler 2-throw cranks (180 degrees). Thus firing orders are not correct in those engines. Also the 42-cyl Zvezda M503 was done with radial-6s instead of the real life radial-7s because I couldn't find proper Lego parts for connecting pistons to the crankshaft. The Sherman 6046 U12 engine gearing and phase offset between the shafts were unknown to me so I just guessed them to be 1:1 and 90 degrees. In other ways the models should be correct (hopefully). The V8 has a flat-plane crank that were used in Formula One engines. Lotus 46 H16 flat-plane crank, gearing and phase between the shafts should be correct according to the schema image I found (shown in the video). The U12 has both crankshafts rotating to the same direction as was explained in mapleleafup forum.\n\nPhoto attributions:\n\"Kimi Raikkonen 2007 Britain 2\" by Rob Snell (CC BY 2.0)\n\"Sherman M4A2E8 at CFB Borden\" by Balcer (CC BY 2.5)\n\"Lotus 43 Goodwood Festival of Speed 2015\" by neilhooting (CC BY 2.0)","likes":123368,"views":6001573,"resolution":"1280x720","website":"Youtube","duration":757,"uploader":"Brick Experiment Channel","uploaderUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClsFdM0HzTdF1JYoraQ0aUw","size":50948304.383999996,"format":"mp4"},"Sun Feb 27 2022 03:27:46 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiTg6Oy0gbc":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiTg6Oy0gbc","date":"2022-02-27T02:27:46.635Z","opts":{"path":"C:\\Users\\tomfl/Downloads/IvyDl Videos","quality":"best","audio":"best","video":"best","autoconvert":true,"format":"mp4","ytdlLoc":"./ext/yt-dlp.exe"},"status":"done","title":"if my heart rate goes above 100bpm, you get 100 dollars","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/qiTg6Oy0gbc/maxresdefault.webp","description":"Catch me live at https://twitch.tv/maya\n\nSupport the horror shorts featured:\n‚ñ∫ MAN ON A TRAIN (Horror Short) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0poUY6B7aM\n‚ñ∫ One Last Dive https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV0pNU9htnw\n‚ñ∫ Selfie from Hell - Award winning Horror Short Film https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhAFyaObY6U\n‚ñ∫ Knock Knock | Short Horror Film https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwDIz2YNQSo\n\nALVEUS MERCH WEEEE: \n‚ñ∫ https://merch.streamelements.com/alveussanctuary\n\nFollow my social media:\n‚ñ∫ Twitter: https://twitter.com/mayahiga \n‚ñ∫ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/maya_higa\n‚ñ∫ Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/mayahiga\n\nAlveus Sanctuary Official Website:\n‚ñ∫ https://www.alveussanctuary.org/\n\nFollow Alveus Socials here:\n‚ñ∫Twitter: https://twitter.com/AlveusSanctuary \n‚ñ∫Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/alveussanctuary/ \n‚ñ∫TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@alveussanctuary \n‚ñ∫Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/alveussanctuary\n\nSubscribe to my second channel for daily uploads\n‚ñ∫ https://www.youtube.com/c/MayaDaily/videos\n\nConservation Cast Official Website:\n‚ñ∫ https://conservationcast.net/\n\nEdited by:\n‚ñ∫ https://twitter.com/BrodyTayMann\n\nOutro Song: \n‚ñ∫ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM7TUvBovYo\n\nChapters: \n0:00 - intro\n1:08 - spooky vids\n26:39 - outro\n\n#maya\n#higa\n#twitch","likes":9445,"views":159329,"resolution":"1280x720","website":"Youtube","duration":1693,"uploader":"Maya","uploaderUrl":"http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeIuImWY9NA05cbRJd4cFIw","size":190490400.64,"format":"mp4","filename":"C:\\Users\\tomfl\\Downloads\\IvyDl Videos\\if my heart rate goes above 100bpm, you get 100 dollars [qiTg6Oy0gbc].mp4"},"Mon Feb 28 2022 05:38:40 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkXmO-5e0YQ":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkXmO-5e0YQ","date":"2022-02-28T04:38:40.012Z","opts":{"path":"C:\\Users\\tomfl/Downloads/IvyDl Videos","quality":"best","audio":"best","video":"best","autoconvert":true,"format":"mp4","ytdlLoc":"./ext/yt-dlp.exe"},"status":"done","title":"Advanced Building","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/DkXmO-5e0YQ/maxresdefault.webp","description":"Hey everyone! üí™ These are some of the most common strategies that I use in fights against skilled players.
